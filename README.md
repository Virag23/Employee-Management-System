THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS AN EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES A USER INTERFACE FOR MANAGING EMPLOYEES, USING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CORDOVA FOR THE MOBILE INTERFACE, DATATABLES FOR SERVER-SIDE RENDERING AND SORTING, AND PHP FOR THE BACKEND API. THE SYSTEM WILL ALLOW USERS TO MANAGE EMPLOYEE DATA, VIEW EMPLOYEE DETAILS, AND PERFORM ACTIONS LIKE ADDING, EDITING, OR DELETING RECORDS. IT WILL INVOLVE THREE RELATED TABLES IN THE BACKEND (SUCH AS EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, AND POSITIONS) AND SERVER-SIDE DATA PROCESSING WITH SORTING, FILTERING, AND PAGINATION

SYSTEM COMPONENTS

FRONTEND (MOBILE INTERFACE) TECHNOLOGY: 
APACHE CORDOVA
 ROLE: THE FRONTEND WILL PROVIDE A TAB APP INTERFACE THAT CAN DISPLAY DATA TO USERS AND ENABLE INTERACTIONS WITH THE BACKEND VIA RESTFUL APIS.
 
 PAGES: EMPLOYEE DASHBOARD: DISPLAYS THE LIST OF EMPLOYEES USING DATATABLES FOR ENHANCED SORTING, FILTERING, AND PAGINATION FEATURES.
 
 EMPLOYEE DETAILS PAGE: SHOWS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE DETAILS, SUCH AS NAME, DEPARTMENT, AND POSITION.
 
 ADD/EDIT EMPLOYEE PAGE: A FORM FOR ADDING AND EDITING EMPLOYEE DETAILS.


 BACKEND (API)
 TECHNOLOGY: PHP

 ROLE: THE BACKEND WILL HANDLE THE LOGIC TO RETRIEVE DATA, INSERT NEW RECORDS, AND UPDATE OR DELETE EXISTING ONES. IT WILL PROVIDE API ENDPOINTS THAT CAN BE CONSUMED BY THE FRONTEND.
 
 ENDPOINTS: 
     RETRIEVE ALL EMPLOYEES, WITH FILTERING, SORTING, AND PAGINATION (HANDLED SERVER SIDE).
     RETRIEVE A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE'S DETAILS. POST /EMPLOYEES: ADD A NEW EMPLOYEE TO THE DATABASE.
     EDIT AN EXISTING EMPLOYEE'S DETAILS.
     DELETE AN EMPLOYEE'S RECORD. 

     
 DATABASE TABLES:
 
 EMPLOYEES: STORE EMPLOYEE DATA (ID, NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID, POSITION_ID).
 
 DEPARTMENTS: STORE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION (ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME).
 
 POSITIONS: STORE POSITION INFORMATION (ID, POSITION_NAME).
 
 RELATIONSHIPS: EMPLOYEES ARE LINKED TO DEPARTMENTS AND POSITIONS VIA DEPARTMENT_ID AND POSITION_ID. WE WILL JOIN THESE TABLES TO FETCH EMPLOYEE DATA ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED DEPARTMENT AND POSITION NAMES.
